Welcome To project-X 
Made By Darkwar
You Can not copy this code with the licness i put on this 

installing:
apt install python python-pip
pip install -r requirement.txt
python project-x

if you use toolx to move the files use
mv <file diretory> <file path>

Info:
*Note this code needs root*
This system will install crap load of hacking tools on your system if your using ubunto 
it will install kali and parrot tools only some of them theow  to install full use Tool-X

For Tool-X After isntalling it it will make files in sudo format only to fix that use
chmod 777 <file name>

airegeddon dont have all the tools it needs soo you got to install them your self 

Notice if you dont have port forwarding then you cant use ssh then for remote access to enable it 
go to router admin panel and port forward port 22
